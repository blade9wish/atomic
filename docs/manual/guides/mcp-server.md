title: MCP Server
description: Give AI agents long-term memory by connecting them to Atomic through the Model Context Protocol.
---

Atomic exposes an MCP server so AI agents can search, read, create, and update atoms. You can use it locally through the desktop app bridge or remotely through the self-hosted HTTP endpoint.

## Tools

Atomic exposes four MCP tools:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `semantic_search` | Hybrid keyword + semantic search over atoms, with optional `since_days` recency filtering |
| `read_atom` | Read full atom content by ID, with line-based pagination |
| `create_atom` | Store new markdown memory as an atom |
| `update_atom` | Replace an existing atom's markdown content |

The server instructions tell agents to search before answering from memory, remember durable context, and update stale atoms instead of duplicating them.

## Desktop App: Local Bridge

The desktop app bundles `atomic-mcp-bridge`, a stdio-to-HTTP bridge. It reads the local sidecar connection automatically, so you do not need to create or paste a token.

Open **Settings > Integrations > MCP Integration** in the desktop app for the exact bridge path.

Example for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any stdio MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atomic": {
      "command": "/Applications/Atomic.app/Contents/MacOS/atomic-mcp-bridge"
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows the binary name is `atomic-mcp-bridge.exe`. On Linux the path depends on the installed package layout.

## Remote or Self-Hosted: Streamable HTTP

For self-hosted servers, connect to:

```text
https://your-server.example/mcp
```

Use a Bearer token:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atomic": {
      "url": "https://your-server.example/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Some clients use `"type": "url"` for HTTP MCP servers. If your client requires it, add that field to the `atomic` object.

## Create a Token

From the UI, create a dedicated token in Settings or the onboarding integration step.

From the CLI:

```bash
atomic-server --data-dir ./data token create --name "claude"
```

Save the raw token immediately. It is shown only once.

## Multi-Database

To target a specific database, add the `db` query parameter:

```text
https://your-server.example/mcp?db=<database-id>
```

Without `db`, MCP tools use the active database.

## OAuth and Public URL

Remote MCP OAuth discovery depends on `PUBLIC_URL` / `--public-url`. If this is not set, OAuth discovery endpoints return 404.

For self-hosted deployments:

```bash
PUBLIC_URL=https://atomic.example.com docker compose up -d
```

Your reverse proxy must pass:

- `/mcp`
- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `/oauth/register`
- `/oauth/authorize`
- `/oauth/token`

## Suggested Agent Prompt

Add guidance like this to your project instructions:

```markdown
You have access to Atomic, your long-term memory. Search Atomic before answering
questions that may relate to past context. Store durable preferences, decisions,
project context, and important facts. Update stale atoms instead of creating
duplicates.
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Desktop bridge cannot connect** - open Atomic first; the sidecar runs while the desktop app is running.
- **HTTP MCP returns 401** - create a new token and update your MCP client config.
- **Remote OAuth discovery fails** - set `PUBLIC_URL` and verify the `.well-known` routes through your proxy.
- **Agent cannot find expected memory** - check that it is using the intended database.
